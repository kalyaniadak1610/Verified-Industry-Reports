This growth is primarily driven by increasing demand for gluten-free, low-carb, and high-protein food products, as well as rising awareness of the health benefits of almond flour. The product's versatility in both commercial and household cooking, particularly in baking, is propelling its adoption globally. Almond flour is also increasingly popular among consumers who follow specific dietary preferences, such as paleo, keto, and vegan diets. The growing trend toward healthier, clean-label ingredients in food and beverage products is expected to continue driving demand in the coming years.</p><p>Additionally, the rise of plant-based eating habits and the growing prevalence of food allergies and intolerances, including celiac disease, are contributing to the increasing consumption of almond flour.
